## Registers
A <em>register</em> is a group of flip-flops with a shared clock, used for storing or shifting data

A <em>counter</em> is a sequence of flip-flops that cycles through states based on clock pulses

<em>Tri-state bus</em> allows for multiple registers to share a common data line by enabling one register's output at a time
